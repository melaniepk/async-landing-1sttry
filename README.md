# async-landing-1sttry

Hello! this is my first try at consuming an API and also trying out more advanced js tools such as asyncronism. 
As yoy may see, this is just a landing page I made following a Plazi course called "Curso de Asincronismo con JavaScript" which helped me to understand these concepts way more deeply than before, for what I am really thankfull. 
The full concept is my favourite group, BTS, which I love and admire so much and I would really like to share more about them to the world, so I just thought why not using this learning oportunity and make it about them? hahah. You can also see some of their latest youtube videos on the page! 
Thank you for reading, lots of love <3
